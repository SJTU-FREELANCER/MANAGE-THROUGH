(1)	Debugging scrapy project (tried to crawl data from the link of the website)
Result: decided not to crawl job description, other information is enough, later we can use special program to do that
(2) Debugging code （tried to put crawled data into database）
(3) Scrapy project for crawling RESUME from website
The first thought was to use scrapy to make reptiles. But at the time of production, found that the content can not be stored in the local variable response. When I load a web page through the shell, although the content can be stored in response, using xpath to get the data I need, the return is null.Considering that the data is in the source code, so I found Python beautifulSoup which also can crawl the data. Currently learning it and writing the code which uses urllib and beautifulSoup.
